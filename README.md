## üöÄ Quick Start

You can use this MCP server in MCP-capable clients such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) and [CherryStudio](https://www.cherry-ai.com/).

### Claude Desktop

For Claude Desktop, add the following configuration under the "mcpServers" section in your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rss-reader": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "rss-reader-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage Examples

- Basic RSS feed fetching

  > Can you fetch the latest 5 headlines from the BBC News RSS feed?
  > URL: <https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml>

- Full article content extraction
  > Please extract the full content of this article and format it as Markdown:
  > <https://example.com/news/article-title>

## üîß Tools Reference

### `fetch_feed_entries`

Fetch RSS entries from a specified URL

**Parameters:**

- `url` (required string): RSS feed URL
- `limit` (optional number): Maximum number of entries to return (default 10, max 100)

**Returns:** A JSON object containing feed metadata and a list of entries (including title, link, publication date, and summary)

### `fetch_article_content`

Extract article content from a URL and format it as Markdown

**Parameters:**

- `url` (required string): Article URL

**Returns:** A JSON object containing the title, Markdown content, source URL, and timestamp

## ‚öôÔ∏è Transport & Environment Variables

This server supports two transport modes:

- stdio (default): Communicates via standard input/output. Suitable for clients that run a local process, such as Claude Desktop.
- httpStream: Communicates over HTTP streaming. Suitable for clients that support HTTP(S) transport or for containerized deployments.

Available environment variables:

- TRANSPORT: Select the transport mode, either `stdio` (default) or `httpStream`.
- PORT: When `TRANSPORT=httpStream`, the listening port (default `8081`).
- MCP_SERVER_HOST: When `TRANSPORT=httpStream`, the listening address (default `localhost`). In Docker, set this to `0.0.0.0` to expose the port externally.

How to switch transport modes:

- Using stdio (no extra setup, default):
  - Works with Claude Desktop via the `command + args` configuration (see example above).
- Using httpStream:
  - Set the environment variable `TRANSPORT=httpStream` and specify `PORT` (defaults to 8081 if not set).
  - When running in a container, also set `MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0` and map the port.
  - The Dockerfile in this repository already includes related environment variable settings.

## Docker Deployment

You can also run this MCP server in a Docker container. First, build the image in the project root:

```bash
docker build -t rss-reader-mcp .
```

Using CherryStudio as an example, the following configuration shows how to run this server over HTTP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rss-reader-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-p",
        "8081:8081",
        "-e",
        "PORT=8081",
        "rss-reader-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
